# Pronunciation rules for isiXhosa.
#
# Author: mjansche@google.com (Martin Jansche)
#
# These rules transcribe isiXhosa into the phoneme inventory used within the
# NCHLT Speech Corpus (https://sites.google.com/site/nchltspeechcorpus/home).
#
# The rules were tested using the NCHLT-inlang isiXhosa pronunciation dictionary
# (http://rma.nwu.ac.za/index.php/resource-catalogue/nchlt-inlang-dictionaries.html).
# They correctly account for 14,999 out of 15,000 entries in the dictionary.
#
# The NCHLT 2013 phone set does not distinguish short and long vowels and does
# not indicate tone in any way. Transcription of tone is out of scope without a
# dictionary, since tone is generally not indicated in the orthography.
#
# One minor notational difference here is that we use a tie bar for the complex
# (slack voiced) clicks, e.g. ɡ͡ǀ instead of ɡǀ, to avoid ambiguity and make the
# phoneme inventory uniquely decodable.
