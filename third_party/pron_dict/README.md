The original Icelandic pron_dict distribution, which we're
redistributing here, consists of the following three files:

* license.txt
* readme.txt
* WordList_IPA_SAMPA.xls

We have added the following files:

* README.md
* WordList_IPA_SAMPA.csv: This file is the result of opening
WordList_IPA_SAMPA.xls in Libreoffice 4.0.4.2 and saving it in "Text
CSV" format with default options, i.e. character set "Unicode (UTF-8)",
comma as field delimiter, and double quotes text delimiter.
