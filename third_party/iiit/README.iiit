The IIIT-H Indic speech databases were developed at Speech and Vision
Lab, IIIT-H for the purpose of building speech synthesis systems in
Indian languages.

Languages
---------
Currently the IIIT-H Indic speech databases consist of text and speech
data in Bengali, Hindi, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and
Telugu. These languages were chosen, as the total number of Wikipedia
articles in each of these languages was more than 10,000 and native
speakers of these languages were available in the campus. Each of
these languages have several dialects. As an initial approximation, we
chose to record the speech in the dialect in which the native speaker
was comfortable with.

Text Data
---------
We used Wikipedia articles in Indian languages as our text corpus. A
set of 1000 sentences was selected for each language. These sentences
were selected to cover 5000 most frequent words in text corpus of the
corresponding language. The text data is made available in IT3 (a
transliteration scheme) as well as in Unicode (UTF-8 format).

Speech Recording
----------------
The speech data was recorded by a native speaker of the language. The
recording was done in a studio environment using a standard headset
microphone connected to a Zoom handy recorder. We used a handy
recorder as it was highly mobile and easy to operate. By using a
headset the distance from the microphone to a mouth and recording
level was kept constant.
