# Sinhala phonemic transcription guide

This document sets out areas in which the pronunciation of Sinhala words is
either not fully predictable from their orthography, or in which the
pronunciation differs from what would be expected from the orthography. It is
these areas of ambiguity or uncertainty that require intervention by human
transcribers.

These guidelines do not cover the full details of Sinhala phonology and the
grapheme-phoneme correspondence. We assume that a rough transcription can be
obtained by deterministic pronunciation rules and that human transcribers
should mainly focus on correcting the automatic transcriptions, especially
with respect to each of the following areas.


## Historic syllabic consonants

The modern Sinhala pronunciation of the historic syllabic consonants ඍ  ෘ
(gæṭa yanna/pilla) and ඎ  ෲ (diga gæṭa yanna/pilla) is not fully predictable
(Wasala et al. 2006, p. 895). At the beginning of a word ඍ is often read
/ri/. In non-initial position,  ෘ can be read /ru/ or /ur/.

The following examples are taken from Wasala et al. 2006:

Orthography | Transcription | Gloss
------------|---------------|------
ඍණ | ri.nə | minus
කෘතිය | kru.ti.jə | book
විවෘත | wi.wur.tə | opened


## æda pilla

The pronunciation of  ැ (æda pilla) and  ෑ (diɡa æda pilla) is not fully
predictable. The vowel stroke  ැ (æda pilla) can be read either /æ/ (common)
or /u/ (less common). Analogously,  ෑ can be read /æː/ or /uː/.

The following examples are based on Wasala et al. 2006:

Orthography | Transcription | Gloss
------------|---------------|------
කැවුම | kæw.mə | traditional sweet
ජනශ්‍රැති | ɟa.nə.ʃru.ti | legend, folklore
රෑයියා | ræːj.jaː | insect
ක්‍රෑර | kruː.rə | cruel


## Diphthongs

Views on the nature of diphthongs in Sinhala differ widely. Masica (p. 116)
states unequivocally that "Sinhalese [...] has no diphthongs". This contrasts
with accounts that posit up to 20 diphthongs. This much is clear: any of the 12
main vowels (excluding schwa /ə/ and /əː/) can be followed by an off-glide
(either /j/ or /w/) in syllable coda position. This leaves open the question of
whether a homosyllabic vowel plus glide sequence constitutes a diphthong or
not. (This guide does not attempt to answer that question. An answer would have
to look for a contrast between e.g. /uj/ on the one hand, and /u.i/ or /u.ji/ or
/u.j/ on the other.) For simplicity, the term "diphthong" is retained here to
refer to a homosyllabic vowel+glide sequence. A possibly incomplete inventory of
diphthongs is as follows:

Diphthong | Example | Transcription | Gloss | Notes
----------|---------|---------------|-------|------
uj  | රුයිත | ruj.tə | diamond | යි
ej  | මැරෙයි | mæ.rej | get killed | යි
oj  | කොයි | koj | where | යි
æj  | ඇයි | æj | why | යි
aj  | කෛරාටික | kaj.raː.ʈi.kə | cunning | ඓ
uːj | ඌයි | uːj | hurt | යි
eːj | ඒයි | eːj | to call someone | යි
oːj | හෝයිය | hoːj.ja | take an effort | යි
æːj | රෑයියා | ræːj.jaː | insect | යි
aːj | ආයි | aːj | again | යි
iw  | ලිව්වා | liw.waː | write | ව්
ew  | කෙරෙව්වා | ke.rew.waː | had done | ව්
ow  | සොරොව්ව | so.row.wə | sluice gate | ව්
æw  | කැවුම | kæw.mə | traditional sweet | වු
aw  | කෞතුක | kaw.tu.kə | relic | ඖ
iːw | මීව්වා | miːw.waː | buffalo calf | ව්
eːw | | | |
oːw | හෝව් | hoːw | stop | ව්
æːw | හෑව්වා | hæːw.waː | plough | ව්
aːw | ලාවුලු | laːw.lu | fruit | වු

Note that the same diphthong can be written in different ways. For example, the
diphthong /aj/ can be written as follows in different words:

Example | Transcription | Notes
--------|---------------|------
කෛරාටික | kaj.raː.ʈi.kə | ඓ
නම්‍යයි | nam.jaj | යි
අය්ය | aj.jə | ය්

Further note that යි does not always signal the presence of a diphthong. An
obvious example where this is not the case is the word සිටියි /si.ʈi.ji/.


## The inherent vowel

The main challenge for Sinhala phonemic transcription is the treatment of the
unwritten inherent vowel. This vowel occurs when a consonant letter is not
followed by a dependent vowel or an explicit virama (hal kirima). Wasala et
al. 2006 view this situation as one of vowel epenthesis, but this is slightly
misleading: the inherent vowel is virtually always realized when indicated in
the orthography, and Wasala et al. do not report other cases of epenthesis
(e.g. for cluster simplification). In fact the main question concerns the
quality of the inherent vowel: Is the inherent vowel realized as /ə/ or /a/
(both common) or as /əː/ or /aː/ (both rare)?

Examples of the possible realizations of the independent vowel include:

Realization | Example | Transcription | Gloss
------------|---------|---------------|------
ə  | කර | kə.rə | to do
a  | නම්‍යයි | nam.jaj | flexible
əː | පරණ | pa.rəː.nə | old
aː | අම්ම | am.maː | mother (misspelling?)
