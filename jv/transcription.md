# Javanese phonemic transcription guide

This document sets out guidelines for representing the pronunciation of Javanese
words. The goal of phonemic transcription is to provide an accurate
representation of the contrasting segments (phonemes) of the language. This will
allow a computer (or an absolute beginner learning Javanese as a second
language) to pronounce words and sentences correctlly.

The transcription system proposed here is, to the largest extent possible,
identical to the modern orthography of Javanese in Latin script. However, there
are some questions around the status of the phoneme inventory that need to be
resolved. Depending on the exact phoneme inventory, some additional diacritics
and conventions need to be introduced that differ from the standard orthography.

## Phonemes

The following is a list of potential phonemes of Javanese, subject to discussion
and clarification.

Orthographic form | IPA | comment
------------------|-----|--------
p | p
b | b
f | f
v | v | needs review
m | m
t | t
d | d
l | l
n | n
s | s
z | z | needs review
r | r
sy | ʃ
th | ʈ
dh | ɖ
c | t͡ʃ
j | d͡ʒ
y | j
ny | ɲ
k | k
g | g
kh | x
w | w
ng | ŋ
' | ʔ | see below
h | h
i | i
é | e
ě | ə | see below
è | ɛ
a | a
u | u
o | o
å | ɔ | see below


The proposal here is to transcribe words by respelling them in the orthographic
inventory. This is best illustrated by example:

Word      | Respelling
----------|-----------
Google    | gugěl
Facebook  | fésbuk
Uniqlo    | yuniklo
psikologi | sikologi
request   | rěkuèst
change    | cénj
hothead   | hot-hèd

## Open issues

The following issues need to be resolved:

* What is the status of /v/? Is it a stand-alone phoneme, distinct from /f/?

* What is the status of /z/ as a phoneme?

* What is the status of /å/, especially in foreign words? If it is treated as a
  phoneme, what is the most convenient notation of it? Is "å" easy enough to
  type?

* What is the status of the glottal stop /'/ as a phoneme?

* What is the best way to transcribe the schwa sound, /ě/ in the current
  proposal? Is "ě" easy enough to type? We could use plain "e", but that
  potentially risks some ambiguity.
