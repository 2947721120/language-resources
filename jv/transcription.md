# Javanese phonemic transcription guide

This document sets out guidelines for representing the pronunciation of Javanese
words. The goal of phonemic transcription is to provide an accurate
representation of the contrasting segments (phonemes) of the language. This will
allow a computer (or an absolute beginner learning Javanese as a second
language) to pronounce words and sentences correctly.

The transcription system proposed here is, to the largest extent possible,
identical to the modern orthography of Javanese in Latin script. In order to
distinguish phonemic transcription from orthography and to avoid ambiguities,
phonemes are always separated from each other by spaces.
